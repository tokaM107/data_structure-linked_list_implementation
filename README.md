### advantage of linked lists:
#### 1.Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, as memory allocation is done at runtime.
#### 2.Insertion and Deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list is efficient, especially for large lists.
### disadvantage of linked lists:
#### 1.lists provided sequencual access of elements.
#### 2.linked lists waste memory in terms of extra reference points.
#### 3.linked lists are hard to manipulate
